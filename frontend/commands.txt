Connecting to Quest 2:
1. Connect with USB
2. `adb devices` (confirm that it's authorized)
3. `adb tcpip 5555` (restart in TCP mode port)
4. `adb shell ip route` (Quest IP address is at the end)
5. *unplug Quest 2 from Mac*
6. `adb connect {Quest IP}:5555`

If without USB:
1. Connect with USB
2. adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000 (connects port 3000 on Mac to port 3000 on device)

Finds Mac local IP (unsure where this is useful):
ipconfig getifaddr en0

Opens Next.js server on Quest 2:
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://192.168.2.25:3000" 

Get access to Chrome console on Brave:
brave://inspect/#devices

You have to use https to start VR sessions, so --experimental-https is necessary for next dev.
