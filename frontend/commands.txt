Connecting to Quest 2:
1. Connect with USB
2. `adb devices` (confirm that it's authorized)
3. `adb tcpip 5555` (restart in TCP mode port)
4. `adb shell ip route` (Quest IP address is at the end)
5. *unplug Quest 2 from Mac*
6. `adb connect {Quest IP}:5555`
- `adb connect 192.168.2.26:5555` at home

If without USB:
1. Connect with USB
2. adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000 (connects port 3000 on Mac to port 3000 on device)

Finds Mac local IP (unsure where this is useful):
ipconfig getifaddr en0
